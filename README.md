# Microsoft Valid Parentheses Problem

This project was part of a Microsoft technical interview for the role of Senior Software Engineer

Given an input string consisting of opening and closing brackets. The opening brackets can be any one of the following – ‘(‘ , ‘{‘ or ‘[‘ . You must have figured out the closing brackets, it could be any one of – ‘)’ , ‘}’ or ‘]’ . Given an input string with a combination of opening and closing brackets, we need to find out if the string has matching parentheses. There are 2 conditions for the input string to be valid –

- Every opening bracket must have a closing bracket of the same type.
- The opening and closing order must match.
